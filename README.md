# Homework_4 JavaScript: Quiz
This script offers a user to take a code quiz. Timer starts from the moment page loads. I know I can make it start when I click ‘Start Quiz’ button, but it will take extra time. Asked for help from LA, but did not succeed. And I am already behind. When I click ‘Start Quiz’ button, first question shows up. When I answer the question, I am presented with another question. Text below shows if answer was correct or wrong. When I answer the question incorrectly, time is subtracted from clock. When all questions are answered then the game is over. When the game is over, I can save my initials and score. When the timer reaches 0 page reloads. 

Creating an object would be an elegant way to do this task. I did that in lines 24-38 of JS file. But something did not work. LA offered me to create three arrays instead. I did that in lines 40-46. 

There are few more features that I would suggest to my client. I can make “Clear Highscores” button to clear the scores. 

Next, I can suggest to set initials and score in the local storage to make it accessible for other applications. Next, I can write a condition that would verify if a user actually entered something. Last, I can suggest that link in the top left corner to display 10 highest scores.
