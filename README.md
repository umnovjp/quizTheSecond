# Homework_4 JavaScript: Quiz
This script offers a user to take a code quiz. When I click ‘Start Quiz’ button, questions start showing up.

When I answer the question, I am presented with another question. Text below shows if answer was correct or wrong. When I answer the question incorrectly, time is subtracted from clock. When all questions are answered then the game is over. When the game is over, I can save my initials and score. When the timer reaches 0 page reloads.

Something I tried but did not succeed. Creating an object would be an elegant way to do this task. I did that in lines 24-38 of JS file. But something did not work at that time. LA offered me to create three arrays instead. I did that in lines 40-46. 

There are few more features that I would suggest to my client. I can make “Clear Highscores” button to clear the scores. Next, I can write a condition that would verify if a user actually entered something. It is easy thing to do. Last, I can suggest that link in the top left corner to display 10 highest scores.
